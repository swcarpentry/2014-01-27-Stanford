# Scientific Python

In the next couple of hours, we will focus on a few libraries from the
scientific Python 'eco system'. The three core libraries are:

- numpy : arrays and numerical computations
- scipy : many algorithms for scientific computing
- matplotlib : visualization

There are many other libraries, and we will give you pointers to these as well.

# Let's get going

To start the notebook, please change your working directory to
`2013-09-16-ISI/lessons/scipy` directory and type `ipython notebook` from the
commandline.  This will start the ipython notebook server and open a web
browser showing the ipython notebook dashboard with the notebooks we will use here.
